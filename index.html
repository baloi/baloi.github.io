        Installing packages:

        * Connect to LAN
        * # export PKG_PATH=ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/5.6/packages/i386/
        * # pkg_add vim

        Works!

        Setup global vimrc file:
        
        * # cp /usr/local/share/vim/vim74/vimrc_example.vim /usr/local/share/vimrc

        Install git:
        * # pkg_add git

        This will be my log of what I have done with my BSD machine. I just 
installed this from my flash drive by doing the following:

  * downloaded install56.fs the OpenBSD website

  * erased contents of a flash drive using GUI diskutil

  * use command line diskutil to get current list of devices
    $  diskutil list

       // my flash drive was /dev/disk1

  * unmount flash drive
    $ diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk1

  * wrote install56.fs to disk
    $ sudo dd if=install56.fs of=/dev/rdisk1 bs=1m

        // Note that using /dev/rdiskN instead of /dev/diskN may be faster

  * eject
    $ diskutil eject /dev/disk1

  * restart machine you want to install OpenBSD. Make sure that your flash drive 
is plugged in during boot.

        // Note: 
        //      Installation was easy and added user. Did not connect to the
        //      internet yet. This will be for the second install. gcc was 
        //      installed by default with vi also - makes it good. I just could 
        //      not find the sources yet. Maybe sources are not installed by 
        //      default. Installation took much less than 30 minutes. Felt like 
        //      10 minutes.

        Currently only vi and not vim is installed. No syntax highlighting, no
        auto complete, no expandtab, no retab. Bare bones. No Python even.

        Am I in trouble or what? "!!date command in vi works though for 
        timestamping so I am doing something right.
